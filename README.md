# Laravel Livewire Example

This project was created to learn Livewire for Laravel.

## What Does It Do?

I created a `Customer` model with a few fields (`first_name`, `email`, `address`, etc).

Then, I created a Livewire component that displays them all in a table. The component also contains a search bar, which is configured as a Livewire `model` for the `searchStr` field. Then, Livewire updates the table with `Customer` records matching the search terms!
